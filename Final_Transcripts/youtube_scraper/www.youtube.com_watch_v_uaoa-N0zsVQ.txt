Hi there.
I’m Luca
and thanks for joining me on this episode
of AI Simplified in Microsoft Teams.
Today’s episode features
one of my favorite features that I use
almost every day at work:
intelligent meeting recap.
Here I am in my team meeting. Hey Adele!
I just make sure to record and transcribe,
and when the meeting ends,
I’ll see the AI generated recap
for that meeting.
To find your intelligent recap
after the meeting is over, go to the
Meet app
and find your meeting
and click on the “view recap” button.
In the recap I can see different
information and different ways
to catch up on what I might have missed:
meeting notes, follow up tasks,
topics discussed, chapters
that break the meeting into sections,
and even speaker tracking, showing me
which participants spoke and when.
And with Copilot in Teams,
you can ask for follow-up information
you want about the meeting.
For example,
I want to ask Copilot to make a detailed
and easy
to read list out of the meeting summary.
I simply ask Copilot,
“Make a table out of the meeting summary
organized by action item.”
Not only am I caught up on what I missed,
but Copilot made it easy
for me to see that information.
Now I don’t need to worry
about being double booked, joining late,
or having to miss a meeting.
If it is recorded or transcribed,
I will be able to take advantage
of intelligent meeting recap
and Copilot to learn all about
the meeting after it is over!

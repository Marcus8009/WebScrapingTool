Hi - I’m
Luca, a product marketer
for the Microsoft Teams team.
I can’t tell you how often
I ‘ve been pressed for time
while trying to send a thorough
but simple message to my coworkers
on Teams.
Often, I’ll end up with spelling errors
or the wrong tone for the group
and have to go back
and rewrite my message tons of times.
But here’s a tip – now
I can use Microsoft
Copilot in Teams’ Compose Copilot feature
to quickly adjust the length, tone,
and create fleshed-out messages
in my Teams chats with just a few clicks.
Let’s say I want to send a message
to my co-workers
about this upcoming project.
“Hey team, here’s
the schedule for the event I have so far,
does everything look right?”
And then I’ll copy and paste the outline
I have for the project so far, but it’s
just a giant jumbled sentence.
This can clearly be better.
Select the Copilot button in the bottom
here, click adjust and select
“professional”. And voila!
With just a couple of clicks, I was able
to make my content much more presentable
before sending it to my team,
all thanks to Copilot.
And with the power of Compose Copilot
I can also edit my tone and length,
allowing me to adapt my message
to whatever audience I am sending it
to, from a co-worker or friend
all the way up to my boss or a VP!
And that is the power of Copilot!

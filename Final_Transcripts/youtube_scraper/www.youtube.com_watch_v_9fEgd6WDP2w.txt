Copilot in Outlook
can now help you manage your inbox
like never before.
Introducing Prioritize my inbox.
It analyzes all your emails using both
the content of your messages
and the context of your job,
to highlight what's most important.
You can then sort by priority
based on Copilot's analysis.
Let's look at this email
from a new customer.
When you select it,
Copilot shows you why it thinks it's significant,
and highlights what action you need to take.
This customer is important this quarter,
so you teach Copilot
that all emails mentioning them
are top priority.
Now Copilot knows to prioritize
any email from them.
Copilot is your partner -
helping you manage your inbox,
so you don't miss what's most important.

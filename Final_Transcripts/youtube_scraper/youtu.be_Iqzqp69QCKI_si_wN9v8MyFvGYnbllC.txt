At Unilever, we believe there is a huge opportunity
in the end-to-end marketing model
to leverage Copilot,
transforming a largely manual part
of our marketing process: the brief.
At the brief kickoff meeting,
without even prompting,
Copilot could begin to gather all of the relevant
content across data sources.
It could create a first draft,
and when that's ready, share it
with relevant stakeholders for their review.
We call this Smart Briefing.
That's quite powerful.
This is not just about embracing change.
It's about strategically positioning Clifford Chance
for the future while maintaining our core mission
of delivering superior legal service.
The Copilot Agent working alongside the lawyer,
 can autonomously identify risks,
confirm the inclusion of required documents,
and notify stakeholders of next steps.
That just allows
me and my team, to be free and available
to deal with much more complex issues.
So the concept that you could have
your own personal compliance agent is so exciting.
The beautiful thing about Copilot Agents is
it can connect into our existing ecosystem.
When a potential fraud scenario is identified,
the agent will autonomously go and gather
the relevant information
from that source system, perform an analysis,
and provide that analysis back to the fraud colleague.
That always ensures
that a human is in the loop.
We actually built a working prototype
in the space of a week.
It enables us to operate at scale and at speed,
efficiently, accurately.
It allows us to take control over
areas that we need to be focusing on,
to improve our customer experience.

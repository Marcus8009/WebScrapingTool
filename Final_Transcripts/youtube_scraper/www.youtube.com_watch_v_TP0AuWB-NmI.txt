You've got a big
presentation tomorrow,
but zero time to create a deck.
Copilot always has your back.
You already did the strategy work,
you just need some visuals.
Let's ask Copilot to take that Word doc
and turn it into a presentation.
Select “Create a presentation from file”,
search for your document, and send it.
You can actually see how Copilot
is going to outline the presentation
before the slides are even created.
And snap, you've got slides ready to go.
But you can't stop there.
It's still missing a slide
about what happens
if your dog has
an accident in the office.
Let's have Copilot add it.
Okay, last step,
let’s liven up the intro a bit with an image.
Love it.
Now, I've got my visuals ready to go,
let's get some quick presentation tips.
What are some best practices
for a compelling presentation?
Now you're ready to
rock that presentation.

Running late to a meeting?
Need help presenting your best ideas?
What about that dreaded awkward silence?
Copilot in Teams
is here to solve
those inefficient meeting mishaps.
Let's say your last meeting ran long
and you're now late to the next one.
Copilot in Teams has got you covered.
As soon as you join the meeting,
open up Copilot and type in,
“What did I miss in the meeting so far?”
Copilot will comb through the transcript
and get you up to speed in seconds.
Let's ask Copilot to dig a little deeper.
Now, remember,
the more information
you give Copilot, the better the outcome.
For example, type in,
“For each participant in this meeting,
what is their biggest concern?”
But also,
“What are they most excited about?”
Within seconds
Copilot can help you
identify pain points and opportunities
so that you can jump in with fresh ideas.
Now, you're well underway in the meeting
and there's a bit of awkward silence.
Don't panic.
Ask Copilot,
“What questions can the group
ask to generate more ideas?”
Copilot will provide
a list of great questions
so you can get the group
thinking of new ideas
from a different perspective.
Copilot makes every meeting
more efficient and helps
you be present for the discussion
so you can really be in the meeting
when you need to be
and catch up with Copilot when you don't.
And finally, your pro-tip.
After the meeting,
you can use Microsoft Copilot
to summarize the meeting
and draft a recap for the team.
Now, that's impressive.

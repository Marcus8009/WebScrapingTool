In charge of that post-meeting recap?
Copilot is going to help you
put together the most actionable recap
your team has ever seen.
First, let's figure out what decisions
were actually made.
Great.
Now let's assign
some action items and deadlines.
Looks like the team didn't
quite come to a conclusion
on who the speaker should be.
But with the help of Copilot,
I can provide
a recommendation in my recap.
Now, let's get this
puppy out to the team.
Let's draft
an email with all this information.
Make a few quick changes.
Hit send and get ready to wow.

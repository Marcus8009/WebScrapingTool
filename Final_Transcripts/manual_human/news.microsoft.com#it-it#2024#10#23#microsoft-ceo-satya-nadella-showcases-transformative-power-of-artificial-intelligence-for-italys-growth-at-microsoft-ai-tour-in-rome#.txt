Ottobre 23, 2024

Announcing new, innovative projects in collaboration with Italian organizations, leveraging Generative AI across various industries: Brembo, Campari, Ferrero, iGenius, Roma Capitale, and Ospedale San Raffaele.

 

Rome, October 23, 2024 – Today on the occasion of the Microsoft AI Tour Event in Rome, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella underlined the company’s commitment to the country’s sustainable growth and celebrated the excellence of Italian organizations already successfully integrating the cloud and generative AI into their business.

During his opening keynote, Satya Nadella highlighted how responsible and safe use of innovation in cloud and AI is generating new growth opportunities for organizations across Italy, boosting their productivity, creativity, and competitiveness in the global market. Nadella met with business leaders, institutional representatives, and Microsoft’s Italian partner ecosystem, discussing how AI is helping promote Italy’s digital economy and improve people’s lives in the country.

Satya Nadella’s presence in Italy is part of a European tour of capitals kicked off in London, where on 21 October the company confirmed its continued commitment to developing generative AI solutions by announcing new features to Copilot Agents.

Microsoft announced the public preview of Copilot Agents within Copilot Studio. Copilot Agents are like new apps for an AI-powered world that work on behalf of an individual, team or business function to execute and orchestrate business processes. Copilot is how one interacts with these agents, which will take care of routine, low-value tasks. Microsoft additionally unveiled ten new agents within Microsoft Dynamics 365, which will especially help teams in sales, finance, and supply chain.

“We are committed to supporting Italy’s AI transformation and ensuring it benefits everyone,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “The investments we made earlier this month in cloud and AI infrastructure, along with AI skilling, will help ensure broad access to the technology needed for Italy’s people and economy to thrive in this AI era, and it is great to see how so many Italian organizations across every industry are already using our AI platforms and tools to innovate.”

Italy as a strategic hub for Europe, the Mediterranean, and North Africa in the spread of AI innovation

Microsoft’s AI Tour in Italy coincides with the company’s newly announced major investment in Italy – €4.3 billion over the next two years – to expand its hyperscale cloud data center and artificial intelligence infrastructure aimed at helping the country maximize AI opportunities. The investment also includes providing digital skills training to more than 1 million Italians by the end of 2025. As a result of this investment, the Italian Cloud Region will become one of Microsoft’s largest data center regions in Europe and will play a crucial role as a hub not only for Italy but also for the Mediterranean and North Africa.

AI is an unprecedented opportunity for transformation and economic growth for Italy: a recent study developed by Microsoft and TEHA group found that a pervasive adoption of generative AI could increase Italy’s annual GDP by up to €312 billion over the next 15 years, or 18.2%. SMEs in particular could benefit from an increase of €122 billion in added value. According to the study, Italian companies are also experiencing tangible productivity gains thanks to generative AI. Today, 47% of companies using artificial intelligence solutions report a productivity increase of over 5%, while 74% have seen a productivity increase of over 1%. – a significant rate, considering that Italy’s overall productivity growth over the past twenty years has been +1.6%.

Italian companies are showing their interest and commitment to AI. The TEHA research highlights that all companies surveyed have already adopted or plan to adopt generative AI solutions in the near future (vs. 78% last year), highlighting the growing importance of this technology in the Italian business landscape.

Digital AI innovation in Italian organizations

During his visit, Satya Nadella met some of the organizations leading AI adoption in Italy and reaping the most benefits in terms of growth, productivity and new services. He highlighted how local organizations in different industries through strategic partnerships are innovating in key public and private sectors for the country, such as manufacturing, healthcare, public administration, and Made-in-Italy.

“Italian businesses are adopting Microsoft AI technologies to foster growth”, said Vincenzo Esposito, General Manager Microsoft Italy. “Through our initiative AI Lab and our partner ecosystem across the country, we support a wide range of public and private organizations to use AI technologies to drive innovation and enhance productivity, whilst promoting AI skilling.”

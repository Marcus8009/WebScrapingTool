## The Human Energy Crisis: A Call to Action for Leaders

Since the World Health Organization categorized burnout as an “occupational phenomenon” in 2019, it has only become more widespread, exacerbated by recent global events. We’re facing a crisis that extends beyond burnout, encompassing social unrest, geopolitical instability, and economic uncertainty, which collectively strain the invaluable human capital that sustains our organizations. This challenge is being termed the Human Energy Crisis.

Warning signs are evident; while climate change presents physical threats, on a personal level, we’re observing a global mental health crisis characterized by depleted energy and languishing. According to Gallup, seven in 10 people worldwide report they are struggling or suffering.

For leaders, particularly in Human Resources, it is crucial to focus on what can be influenced: the employee experience. Evidence of this Human Energy Crisis manifests dramatically in the workplace. The pandemic has caused workdays to extend by over 13%, with after-hours work increasing significantly. Although the pandemic introduced flexibility into our work schedules, there is a risk that this flexibility could worsen the crisis if not managed properly.

Addressing the Human Energy Crisis requires a new approach to workplace sustainability, aimed at regenerating energy for employees in an ongoing and sustainable manner. 

## Changing Employee Priorities

Recent data from the Work Trend Index indicates that employees worldwide have re-evaluated their priorities. A notable 53% of respondents indicated they prioritize their health and wellbeing over work, with parents and women particularly leading this trend. This shift is evident in the rise of personal wellbeing as a top reason for leaving jobs, as employees navigate their needs for health and happiness against work demands. 

Responsibility for wellbeing cannot rest solely on the individual. Organizations must strive to understand the current impacts on their workforce and adjust their approaches accordingly. 

At Microsoft, we have partnered with our People Analytics team to refine our understanding of the workplace environment. We moved from measuring productivity and engagement to assessing how well employees are thriving—a term we define as being energized and empowered to do meaningful work. 

## Keys to Sustainable Work Environments

To replenish employee energy sustainably, the following six key areas are essential:

### 1. Putting Culture and Purpose Front and Center

A positive culture transformation is critical. Employees need to feel empowered, included, and autonomous. Connection to the company's purpose ensures that their work feels meaningful. Engagement in company culture is an ongoing process and requires continual attention and commitment from all levels of the organization.

### 2. Making Wellbeing Holistic

Wellbeing encompasses mental health, a vital component increasingly affected by external pressures. Many employees report feeling stressed and anxious, with a significant number feeling that their employers do not care for their wellbeing. Companies must fill existing gaps and provide resources for holistic wellbeing, addressing not just individual needs but also fostering a supportive environment.

### 3. Supporting Career Growth in Meaningful Ways

Traditional career paths are being replaced by more flexible and diverse routes to success. Organizations should support career growth through upskilling and mentoring, allowing employees to pursue their passions and apply their skills in fulfilling ways.

### 4. Focusing on Leader and Manager Capabilities

Quality leadership has become even more crucial. Leaders must demonstrate care for employee wellbeing, while managers play a central role in driving employee connection and support. We must equip leaders with the tools necessary to foster energy and engagement within their teams.

### 5. Building Supportive Team Connections

Understanding colleagues' lives outside of work has become more common, and supporting team connections is vital. Strong team dynamics provide emotional support and help energize team members. Companies should encourage an inclusive environment that fosters both serious collaboration and moments of levity.

### 6. Being Intentional in Offering Flexibility

Flexibility should replace performative job behaviors. Organizations need to prioritize impactful work over merely appearing busy. Allowing employees to craft schedules that align with their personal needs fosters autonomy and promotes a healthy work-life balance.

## The Future of Work

To effectively address the Human Energy Crisis, organizations must focus on holistic wellbeing, flexible work arrangements, supportive career growth, and open channels of communication. Leadership needs to prioritize cultural reassessment to foster renewable resources within their talent pool, as positive organizational outcomes hinge on the wellbeing of their people. 

As we move forward, it is clear that addressing the Human Energy Crisis cannot be limited to superficial initiatives; meaningful change is necessary to ensure lasting success for both organizations and their employees.

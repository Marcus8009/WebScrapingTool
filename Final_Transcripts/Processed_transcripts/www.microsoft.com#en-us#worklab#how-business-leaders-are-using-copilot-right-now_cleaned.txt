## Reinvention of Work with Microsoft 365 Copilot

By now, it’s clear: AI will transform work for everyone. Some business leaders have moved to the front of the pack. In the past year, people in industries around the world have adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot, testing how it can revolutionize the way they work. The early results show that Copilot users spend less time on mundane, energy-sapping tasks and more time on high-level, high-value work, allowing leaders to reimagine their business models and pursue once-impossible bold opportunities. One company even utilized AI to help develop a product that boosts crop yields.

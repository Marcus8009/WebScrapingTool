The deployment is indicative of Trace3's commitment to cutting-edge technology. Currently, over 1,250 employees utilize Windows 11 Pro. Derek Smith, Practice Director for Azure, noted the operating system's enhanced security features as vital for the company's innovation-driven and security-conscious environment, highlighting the overwhelmingly positive feedback from employees on the upgrade.

## Employee Mobility and Collaboration

The shift to hybrid work during the pandemic allowed Trace3 employees to work from various locations. Smith emphasized that Windows 11 Pro supports their work-from-anywhere model effectively.

## Introduction

This is WorkLab, the podcast from Microsoft. I’m your host, Molly Wood. On WorkLab, we hear from experts about the future of work, from how to use AI effectively to what it takes to thrive in our new world of work.

## AI in Healthcare

Today I’m talking to Peter Lee, President of Microsoft Research, about what business leaders across industries can learn from the way that AI is transforming medicine and life sciences. He delivers a report from the front lines on the technological innovations that are transforming every aspect of medicine, from research to diagnosis to security and privacy, and even the fundamental way that doctors and patients communicate with each other. 

AI innovations are helping to evolve a healthcare system that is less siloed, less confusing, more thorough, more efficient, more secure, and even more empathetic. If similar transformations aren’t happening in your industry yet, rest assured, they will be soon. Here’s my conversation with Peter.

## Shift in Microsoft's Healthcare Strategy

Let’s start with your shift three and a half years ago, when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella asked you to rethink the company’s healthcare strategy. When did AI become a major focus of this strategy shift?

PETER LEE: Right. Satya first asked me to take a new look at healthcare way back in 2016. I was actually pretty confused by that. I wondered, why is he punishing me? 

MOLLY WOOD: It’s not considered like a fun field to try to transform. 

PETER LEE: It isn’t, but I think Satya really saw the future. Microsoft is in literally every single healthcare organization on the planet—from Kaiser Permanente to a one-nurse clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. His point was the future will be about AI, cloud, and health data. Are we doing enough there? It took a little bit of time to understand what it is about Microsoft that gives us a right to participate here. We asked, "If Microsoft were to disappear today, in what ways would the world of healthcare be harmed?"

When ChatGPT was released in November 2022, I received emails from clinician friends saying they were already using it in their clinics.

## Potential for AI in Medicine

MOLLY WOOD: Healthcare is universal, and it can be really personal and emotional, but also bureaucratic and complicated. What’s the potential for AI to improve the experience?

PETER LEE: Everyone has moments of confusion in the healthcare system. For example, in the U.S., after treatment, you receive something called an Explanation of Benefits form, which is totally mysterious. I've interacted with executives at major health insurance companies who can't even decode those things. Simple solutions like showing lab test results to GPT-4 can provide explanations and clarity. 

Reflecting on personal experience, when my father passed away after a long illness, my sisters and I struggled to care for him from a distance. Using AI to summarize medical notes before speaking with doctors could have helped us ask the right questions and maintain family harmony.

MOLLY WOOD: I’m so sorry to hear about your father.

PETER LEE: Thank you. It was really his time, and he passed peacefully with family around.

## AI and Empathy in Healthcare

MOLLY WOOD: It’s profound to think about technology making such difficult experiences easier. You found that introducing AI into medicine can actually increase empathy. How is that possible?

PETER LEE: Traditionally, technologists focus on AI for diagnosis, such as analyzing images or passing licensing exams. But the human relationship in healthcare matters a lot. AI can prompt doctors to maintain eye contact and be present with patients instead of focusing on a screen. It can also remind doctors of personal details, enhancing their connection with patients.

The aid of an AI system can help doctors manage their workload better. For instance, AI can automate note-taking, allowing more time for meaningful interactions.

MOLLY WOOD: That's a counterintuitive notion, that AI can actually help doctors be more empathetic.

## Real-World Examples

PETER LEE: A colleague of mine had a friend diagnosed with pancreatic cancer who insisted on a specific treatment despite specialists recommending otherwise. My colleague consulted GPT-4, which echoed the specialists' advice but also prompted him to check in on his own mental state during the stressful time. 

Interestingly, studies show that after-visit summaries generated by AI are often rated as more human by patients than those written by doctors.

MOLLY WOOD: That's fascinating. It highlights how AI recognizes the need for empathy, while doctors may struggle to provide it.

PETER LEE: Indeed. The current crisis in U.S. healthcare sees clinicians spending over 40% of their time on clerical tasks, leading to burnout. AI can alleviate this burden, potentially reducing documentation time dramatically.

## Global Perspectives

MOLLY WOOD: You discuss this crisis globally. Is burnout and excessive clerical work only an issue in the U.S.?

PETER LEE: It’s a global issue. The U.S. faces a projected shortage of hundreds of thousands of nurses, while the National Health Service in the UK often has long wait times for primary care. In parts of Africa, many people may never see a doctor in their lifetime, and in China, primary care doctors face caseloads of nearly 80 patients a day.

MOLLY WOOD: That’s staggering.

PETER LEE: There's a demographic shift with an aging population and not enough young healthcare workers to support them. We’re seeing fewer people wanting to enter the profession. It's vital to reshape healthcare roles so that they align with individuals' desires to help others rather than being overwhelmed with paperwork.

## Implementation of AI in Various Industries

MOLLY WOOD: These lessons from healthcare likely extend to other industries. What’s your message for leaders considering AI implementation across sectors?

PETER LEE: Generative AI should not be seen as a computer that performs perfect calculations. It’s more like an eager and tireless intern. Treating it like a computer can be risky in high-stakes settings. Leaders must be hands-on, engaging with AI to understand its strengths and limitations.

Once comfortable, they can explore how AI can structure data to aid in decision-making, which can have widespread applications across sectors.

MOLLY WOOD: What’s your response to those reluctant to engage with AI?

PETER LEE: Empathy is key. I’ve experienced skepticism, annoyance, and ultimately amazement with AI. It's normal to have a journey of acceptance. Organizations must embrace the understanding that adapting to new technology takes time.

## The Future of AI in Medicine

MOLLY WOOD: Is there a specific breakthrough you hope AI will achieve in medicine?

PETER LEE: The goal of real-world evidence (RWE) is significant. Imagine if every patient's healthcare experience contributed directly to advancing medical knowledge. During the pandemic, doctors discovered that positioning COVID patients prone could be life-saving, but the recognition of this took too long. 

Having a system that monitors and records every medical encounter could fast-track the sharing of knowledge in real-time, drastically improving patient outcomes. With AI’s potential, parts of this dream are within reach.

## Introduction

In the age of AI, “what got us here isn’t going to get us where we need to go,” says Kate Johnson, President and CEO of the telecommunications company Lumen. In this episode of the WorkLab podcast, hosted by Molly Wood, Johnson discusses how to transform businesses for the AI era.

## Key Insights on Business Transformation

### 1. Leaders as Change Agents

Johnson emphasizes that leaders must act as catalysts for change within their organizations. “I come in and I say, ‘Hey, what got us here isn’t going to get us where we need to go, so we need to change things.’” She highlights the importance of having difficult conversations to uncover unspoken issues that need to be addressed. “You can’t fix what you don’t know exists,” she adds.

### 2. The Value of AI in Augmenting Humans

According to Johnson, the true value of AI lies in enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing them. She cautions against the common misconception that AI will reduce headcount, stating, “What we need is for them (employees) to be more productive... AI is being very helpful in that journey as well, helping us focus on the right things at the right time during our transformation life cycle.”

### 3. Balancing Change and Adoption

“It’s important to realize that AI adoption can be daunting,” Johnson remarks, noting that leaders must find the right balance in pushing for change without overwhelming their teams. She shares her personal experience, acknowledging her own initial struggle with AI adoption and the realization that true adoption occurs when AI becomes a natural part of the workflow.

### 4. AI's Impact on Sales

Johnson highlights the significant role of AI in Lumen's sales processes. She points out that “AI for sales has been huge for our people,” enabling the company to understand customer journeys more quickly and effectively, particularly with the introduction of tools like Copilot and generative AI.

## Conclusion

The episode concludes with a reaffirmation of the importance of embracing AI as a collaborative tool that complements human efforts. As businesses navigate the complexities of the digital age, leaders must remain proactive in fostering an environment of continuous learning and adaptation.

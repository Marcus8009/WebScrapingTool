## Introduction

This is WorkLab, the podcast from Microsoft. I’m your host, Molly Wood. On WorkLab, we hear from experts about the future of work, from how to use AI effectively to what it takes to thrive in the digital age.

## Podcast Overview

In this episode, we welcome quantitative futurist Amy Webb, who discusses how AI is influencing the workplace. Webb is the CEO of the Future Today Institute, an organization that guides leading companies in navigating emerging trends and identifying growth opportunities.

### Key Insights from Amy Webb

1. **AI's Present Impact**  
   Webb emphasizes that “AI isn't coming to work—it's here.” Currently, AI exists primarily within the generative category, with people familiar with tools like ChatGPT. However, she encourages business leaders to consider how AI can enable other technologies and create new opportunities.

2. **Reevaluating Job Elimination Concerns**  
   While some reports predict that AI could eliminate millions of jobs, Webb believes these estimates are overblown. Instead of viewing AI solely as a cost-cutting measure, she advises leaders to think about how it can enhance revenue opportunities and create new workflows.

3. **Navigating Complexity with Informed Decisions**  
   Webb describes the current business environment as the most complex in the last two decades. She urges leaders to understand AI thoroughly to make informed decisions that are driven by excitement about innovation rather than fear of obsolescence. "I would want to make sure I was well informed so that the decisions I make that contribute to the global conversation are the right ones,” she states.

## Conclusion

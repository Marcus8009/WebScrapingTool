**WorkLab Guest:** Timm Chiusano  
**Date:** September 25, 2024  

“My purpose is helping people do their best work by being the best version of themselves,” says Timm Chiusano, a creative executive turned TikTok superstar. Until a few months ago, Chiusano was Vice President of Production and Creative Services for the advertising and marketing division at Charter Communications. In his spare time, he recorded every aspect of his daily routine with his phone, editing the footage into TikTok videos narrated in a stream-of-consciousness style with insights about leadership, productivity, and creativity. Chiusano quickly built an audience of over a million followers and recently left his day job to focus on his social content and upcoming book, *How to Get Addicted to Appreciation*, due out next year.

## Key Insights from the Conversation

In this episode of the WorkLab podcast, Chiusano joins host Molly Wood to discuss several important topics:

### Let Your Needs Determine Your AI Strategy
Organizations should start by identifying needs that AI can help address, Chiusano says, instead of applying the technology indiscriminately. “Those that are going to have the best long-term outcomes with AI are those that continue to focus on their biggest ideas, and where your customers are going, and then utilizing AI to help them get there versus trying to force it to be the leader in the conversation.”

### The Secret to Good Leadership
Make goals and roles crystal clear. Chiusano finds that the challenge of communicating values and desired outcomes to his team is one of the most rewarding aspects of leadership. “The more clarity you can provide, the better the chance that employees will go home thinking that this was a good day. They feel like they are fulfilling their purpose and delivering value back to a company. They feel safe and secure in their role, and they’re clear on what the outcome should be.”

### Focus on "Winning the Week"
Chiusano emphasizes the importance of structuring personal and team goals on a weekly basis. He notes, “Every company has annual goals. They have quarterly goals. Not a lot of companies have weekly goals.” He believes that this approach can help teams make purposeful progress toward broader objectives and create a feedback loop for continual improvement.

## Additional Thoughts from Timm Chiusano

MOLLY WOOD: This is WorkLab, the podcast from Microsoft. I’m your host, Molly Wood. 

TIMM CHIUSANO: This is what no one tells you about being the boss. You’ve got to do all the behind-the-scenes work so other people’s best work gets them promoted, which also helps you feel better when you feel stuck. Because the higher you get, the harder it gets to get higher. You have a massive impact on budgeting and resources. You have a massive impact on other people’s moods just by how kindly you greet them. You get to help others solve problems and make them feel better about them at the end.

In the age of AI, “what got us here isn’t going to get us where we need to go.” AI is expected to be our most effective, least judgmental tutor, but humans also have their work cut out for them.

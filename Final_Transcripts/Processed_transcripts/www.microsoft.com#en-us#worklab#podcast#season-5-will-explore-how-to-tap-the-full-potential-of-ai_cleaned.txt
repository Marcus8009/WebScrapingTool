### Season 5 Trailer

Hey there, I’m Molly Wood. I’ve spent more than 20 years covering technology and business as a journalist, reporter, and podcaster. You might know me from CNET if you’re really old school, my stories on personal technology and tech trends in The New York Times, or the business of the tech economy on public radio’s Marketplace. As the new host of WorkLab, a Microsoft podcast for business leaders, I’m here to help you make sense of the topic on everyone’s mind. AI isn’t coming; it is here now, and it’s radically transforming the way we work. Some experts say it’s the biggest thing to happen since the computer.

What is AI? What is it not? Why does it matter? How can you stay ahead of the curve and ensure your employees and your organization are using it to its fullest potential? On WorkLab, we explore all of these questions and more. Each week I talk to a new expert about the work trends and insights that business leaders need to know to thrive in today’s digital world. AI is our top focus, but we also cover flexible work, productivity, and innovation. 

Season 5 launches on September 20. I hope you’ll join me as I explore the science of work and ingenuity. Catch you then.

## Introduction

Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) isn’t new technology, but it has recently become a hot topic. There are 33 times as many LinkedIn posts mentioning topics like generative AI and GPT than there were one year ago.

Companies have been incorporating AI into their technology products for decades, but OpenAI has democratized its use for personal and work applications. Some speculate that the impact of AI will be similar to the industrial revolution, raising questions about its effect on jobs—both positive and negative. HR industry analyst Josh Bersin estimates that 8% of jobs will be upgraded and enhanced by AI over time, while additional jobs will be created to harness it.

## Impact on Learning and Development

The rapid expansion of GAI technology is poised to transform learning and development (L&D) teams. Embracing GAI now can provide a competitive edge in the industry. Platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 are widely used for drafting written and visual content in various use cases, including workplace learning. For example, you can request ChatGPT to produce an outline for a leadership development course or create a video script for healthcare compliance training.

Many other technology solutions are incorporating GAI into their platforms, signaling a race among vendors to develop similar capabilities.

The rollout of GAI solutions could cause significant disruptions in the learning and development space, with applications that continue to expand as GAI becomes more sophisticated.

Using GAI for various tasks can lead to increased productivity, enhanced creativity, and improved decision-making. According to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index, 76% of people plan to use AI for administrative tasks like finding the right information, summarizing meetings and planning their day. Additionally, 79% intend to use it for analytical tasks, while 73% aim to leverage it for creative work.

Automating day-to-day tasks can free up time to create more strategic and engaging learning experiences that contribute to better business outcomes.

## Challenges of Generative AI

While generative AI can significantly impact organizations, it also poses challenges that should be considered before integration into L&D programs. For instance, ChatGPT has acknowledged that “while we have safeguards in place, the system may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading information and produce offensive or biased content.” Furthermore, conversations may be reviewed by AI trainers to improve the systems, which presents concerns about accuracy, ethics, and confidentiality.

These issues should discourage, rather than deter, the use of GAI, highlighting the need for establishing guidelines for responsible use. Organizations should collaborate with key stakeholders to build a GAI policy that may include:

- Guidelines for content creation
- Strategies for verifying information
- Ethical considerations in AI usage

Generative AI is gaining traction rapidly, with 43% of professionals already utilizing it in some form at work. Adoption is likely to grow as GAI features are incorporated into more tools used in daily workflows. 

## Conclusion

Embracing GAI now offers the opportunity to harness this technology for a stronger L&D function, which can help future-proof your workforce. In our rapidly evolving world of work, keeping abreast of these emerging trends can be career-changing.

## Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella Showcases AI for Italy’s Growth

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella showcased the transformative power of artificial intelligence for Italy’s growth at the Microsoft AI Tour Event in Rome on October 23, 2024. The event highlighted new, innovative projects in collaboration with Italian organizations that leverage Generative AI across various industries, including Brembo, Campari, Ferrero, iGenius, Roma Capitale, and Ospedale San Raffaele.

During his keynote, Nadella emphasized the responsible and safe use of innovation in cloud and AI, creating new growth opportunities for organizations across Italy while boosting productivity, creativity, and competitiveness in the global market. He met with business leaders, institutional representatives, and Microsoft’s Italian partner ecosystem to discuss how AI is promoting Italy’s digital economy and improving lives.

Nadella’s visit is part of a European tour that started in London, where Microsoft confirmed its commitment to developing generative AI solutions, including new features for Copilot Agents. These agents function as AI-powered assistants for individuals, teams, or business functions to handle routine, low-value tasks.

Nadella stated, “We are committed to supporting Italy’s AI transformation and ensuring it benefits everyone. The investments we made earlier this month in cloud and AI infrastructure, along with AI skilling, will help ensure broad access to the technology needed for Italy’s people and economy to thrive in this AI era.”

### Microsoft’s Major Investment in Italy

The Microsoft AI Tour coincides with the announcement of a substantial investment in Italy amounting to €4.3 billion over the next two years. This investment will expand Microsoft’s hyperscale cloud data center and AI infrastructure, aiming to maximize AI opportunities in Italy. This initiative also aims to provide digital skills training to over 1 million Italians by the end of 2025, with the Italian Cloud Region becoming one of Microsoft’s largest data center regions in Europe, serving as a hub not only for Italy but also for the Mediterranean and North Africa.

A recent study by Microsoft and TEHA group indicates that widespread adoption of generative AI could increase Italy's annual GDP by up to €312 billion over the next 15 years, with SMEs potentially benefiting from an increase of €122 billion in added value. Currently, 47% of companies using AI solutions report a productivity increase of over 5%, while 74% report at least a 1% increase.

### Digital AI Innovation in Italian Organizations

Nadella highlighted the progress of Italian organizations leading the way in AI adoption. Key examples include:

- **Brembo**: Developed ALCHEMIX, an AI solution that accelerates braking system innovation, reducing the development time of new compounds from days to minutes by utilizing Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI.

- **Campari Group**: Adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot to enhance their digital transformation, resulting in time savings of approximately 2 hours per week for employees through improved efficiency in routine tasks.

- **iGenius**: Partnered with Microsoft to enhance their decision intelligence platform, Crystal, targeting companies in regulated sectors. The collaboration aims to bring advanced AI solutions to these organizations.

- **Roma Capitale**: Launched Julia, an AI virtual assistant designed to help tourists discover Rome’s hidden gems, with services accessible via WhatsApp and other channels, using Azure OpenAI technology.

- **Università Vita-Salute**: Partnered with Ospedale San Raffaele to create a cloud-based platform that leverages AI to accelerate clinical research and precision medicine, assisting 1.5 million patients annually.

- **Ferrero**: Initiated Let’s Story, a platform that uses Generative AI to personalize children’s fairy tales, integrating technology from various fields to provide an engaging learning experience.

Nadella's remarks and the innovations presented at the AI Tour reflect a significant commitment by Microsoft to support AI-driven growth across Italy, enhancing productivity and positioning the nation as a leader in AI innovation. 

In addition to the featured organizations, other participants in the AI Tour included illimity, INPS, Lavazza, RINA, and Unipol, each showcasing their own AI-driven initiatives.

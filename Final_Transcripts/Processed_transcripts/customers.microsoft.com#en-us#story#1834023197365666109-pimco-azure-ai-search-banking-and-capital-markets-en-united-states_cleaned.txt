## Introduction

The client-facing teams at PIMCO serve hundreds of thousands of clients worldwide, all requiring accurate, up-to-date information on the products they hold. To boost the client experience, PIMCO aimed to help its associates spend less time aggregating data and more time engaging with clients.

## Building ChatGWM with Azure AI

To facilitate faster access to relevant information, PIMCO developed an enterprise tool named ChatGWM on Azure AI. ChatGWM is a secure, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based application that searches across PIMCO-approved structured and unstructured data sources to deliver timely, relevant information to its teams.

Associates can now type their questions into ChatGWM using advanced search technology, enabling them to receive more insightful responses quickly. The tool also provides the source of its information, helping associates ensure that everything is factually correct.

PIMCO, a global leader in active fixed income with $2 trillion in assets under management (as of September 30, 2024), has served its client base for over 50 years by investing client capital in diverse income and credit opportunities. The company prides itself on its extensive resources and commitment to client service.

## Client Needs and Challenges

PIMCO's client-facing teams require accurate, current information on PIMCO products held by clients. Responsiveness and the quality of content are critical for client service. “Our clients have such diverse investment needs,” says Matthew Schwarz, Head of Business Strategy and Analytics in US Wealth Management at PIMCO. “When clients call with questions about specific funds, our teams need to find accurate answers quickly.”

Finding those answers often involves searching through a vast number of data sources, which can be time-consuming. “Improving our data search process by 10%, or even 5%, would drive scale and efficiency across the company,” states Sanket Bafna, Senior Vice President, Head of Client Data Intelligence and Sales Technology at PIMCO. The organization recognized an opportunity to enhance associate productivity and the client experience through AI.

## Azure AI Integration 

The advancement of large language models (LLMs) provided PIMCO the chance to evolve its quantitative capabilities and improve its client request search process. The team decided to create a chat interface capable of answering questions by searching for relevant information.

Given the strict regulatory requirements surrounding the types of information financial services companies can share with clients, PIMCO ensured that the new interface would only utilize PIMCO-approved data. Azure AI was selected for its breadth of functionality and capabilities. “We loved the completeness of vision Microsoft has shown with AI, including security and compliance. Azure AI has allowed us to spend time building solutions instead of building AI plumbing,” says Bafna.

## Features of ChatGWM

The solution developed was ChatGWM, an advanced RAG application that enhances LLMs by incorporating a knowledge retrieval system for grounding data. Built using Azure AI Foundry, ChatGWM processes information by breaking down data sources into smaller chunks from which it can extract meaningful insights.

Azure AI Document Intelligence extracts information from various sources, and Azure AI Search provides an advanced knowledge retrieval system to effectively process this data using an LLM. The embeddings generated by Azure OpenAI Service enable nuanced, semantic similarity searches for more relevant interactions.

ChatGWM utilizes prompt orchestration and integrates with Azure Logic Apps to ensure real-time updates on documents across multiple storage locations like SharePoint and Box. PIMCO anticipates leveraging new Azure Cosmos DB features such as Vector Search and Full Text Search for continued improvements.

## Enhancements in Client Engagement 

The implementation of ChatGWM is expected to revolutionize how PIMCO’s client-facing teams access information. Instead of manually searching through folders and databases, team members can directly input questions into ChatGWM, leading to faster responses and accurate client information. The tool also allows downloading of source documents to share with clients, effectively improving engagement.

As tasks that previously took significant time become easier to complete, PIMCO expects to save thousands of hours previously spent on manual processes while enhancing the overall client experience. "Tasks that used to take a lot of time are now so much easier to complete," remarks Schwarz.

## Future Endeavors 

Following the success of ChatGWM, PIMCO plans to further embrace Azure AI services to optimize internal operations and continuously enhance the client experience.

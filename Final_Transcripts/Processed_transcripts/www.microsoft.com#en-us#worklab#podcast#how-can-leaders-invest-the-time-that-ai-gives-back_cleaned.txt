## Podcast Overview

Psychologist and author Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic explains how AI can unlock greater performance.

### Guest Introduction

Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic is a professor of business psychology at University College London and Columbia University, and the Chief Talent Scientist at Manpower Group. He has authored several books, including *I, Human: AI, Automation, and the Quest to Reclaim What Makes Us Unique*. In this episode of the WorkLab podcast, he discusses how AI can help improve recruiting, decision-making, and allow for more time to apply our uniquely human skills.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Focus on Value Creation:** 
   Chamorro-Premuzic emphasizes that AI saves time, but the critical question is how to reinvest that time into creating value. Employees aren’t simply looking for more work; leaders should guide their teams in reimagining how to add value with the time AI frees up.

2. **Importance of Coachability:**
   The most crucial leadership skill in the era of AI is coachability. Chamorro-Premuzic asserts that a leader’s potential to grow and adapt will be more critical than past performance, making it essential to welcome feedback and continuously improve.

3. **AI as a “Microwave for Ideas”:**
   AI can expedite mundane tasks, akin to a microwave speeding up cooking. While it can enhance productivity, it also risks automating mediocrity. Evaluating the uniqueness of human output alongside AI-generated content is vital to ensuring quality.

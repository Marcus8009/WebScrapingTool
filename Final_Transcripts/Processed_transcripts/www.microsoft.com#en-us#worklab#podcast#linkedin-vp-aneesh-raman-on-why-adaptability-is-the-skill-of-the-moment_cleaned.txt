## Introduction

This is WorkLab, the podcast from Microsoft, hosted by Molly Wood. On WorkLab, we hear from experts about the future of work, exploring topics from how to use AI effectively to the skills needed to thrive in our evolving work environment.

## Guest Profile

In this episode, we feature Aneesh Raman, vice president at LinkedIn and head of the company’s Opportunity Project, which aims to create a more dynamic and equitable global labor market. Raman has a diverse background, having formerly worked as a CNN war correspondent and as a speechwriter for President Obama.

## Key Insights

Raman discusses the significant findings from LinkedIn’s research on how generative AI is transforming the workforce. He emphasizes that job roles are evolving dramatically, stating, “Jobs are changing all around you even if you aren’t changing jobs.” 

### The Need for Adaptability

According to LinkedIn data, 25% of the skills required for jobs have changed in the last eight years, with projections suggesting that by 2030, 65% of the skills necessary for one’s job will have shifted. Raman observes that this represents essentially a new job. 

He advocates for adaptability as a crucial skill: 

“Adaptability is the best way to have agency right now. I think in a moment of big change like we’re living through now, the thing we all most want is not just a way to understand it but a way to manage it. And at the core of that right now is just going to be building that muscle of adaptability.”

### Skills Over Titles

Raman believes that as AI continues to advance, job titles and formal educational qualifications will become less significant. He insists that employers will need to adopt a skills-first mindset:

“It’s not as easy to filter for skills as you filter for degrees. But I promise everyone that it is easier than any other way that exists to figure out what is going to happen to work, to your job, to your team in the age of AI.”

### Emphasizing People Skills

Raman also highlights the increasing value of soft skills in career development. LinkedIn’s research indicates that 72% of U.S. executives agree that skills like communication, creativity, and adaptability are becoming even more important than technical AI skills. 

He predicts a more human-centric approach to work:

“I envision a world of work that’s more human, not less, because people skills are going to come more to the center of individual career growth, and people-to-people collaboration is going to come into the center more for company growth. For leaders, you’ve got to start with communicating clearly, compassionately, and empathetically with your teams.”

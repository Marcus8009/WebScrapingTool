On February 21, 2024, Molly Wood announced that the year 2024 will be remembered as the moment when AI-powered organizations shifted into overdrive. As business leaders tap the full potential of this transformative technology, they are grappling with vital questions such as:

"Hey there, I’m Molly Wood. I’m the host of WorkLab, a Microsoft podcast for business leaders, which will soon be back with a new season. WorkLab is, in a nutshell, your unfair advantage for getting ahead in our new world of work—meaning everything from productivity hacks to leadership insights to, oh yeah, AI."

This season focuses on helping leaders prepare for the way AI is fundamentally transforming jobs, organizations, entire industries, and the whole economy. Each episode will include discussions around pressing questions such as:

Moreover, she emphasizes the necessity for more humanity in the workplace—not in spite of generative AI, but because of it—along with a new framework for employee retention.

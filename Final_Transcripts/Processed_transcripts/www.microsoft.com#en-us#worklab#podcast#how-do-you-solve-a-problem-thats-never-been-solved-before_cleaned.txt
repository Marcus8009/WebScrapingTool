## Introduction

This is WorkLab, the podcast from Microsoft. I’m your host, Molly Wood. On WorkLab, we hear from experts about the future of work, from how to use AI effectively to what it takes to thrive in our new world of work.

## Guest Insight

In this episode, Microsoft’s adaptive leadership expert, Dr. Britt Aylor, breaks down how to confidently lead in the age of AI. Dr. Aylor is the Director of Leadership Development at Microsoft and has extensive experience in leadership and organizational development. Before joining Microsoft, she was at the Broad Institute, a research center backed by MIT and Harvard, and has closely collaborated with Professor Ronald Heifetz at Harvard, who helped develop the adaptive leadership framework.

The best leaders possess a framework for stepping confidently into the unknown and bringing their teams with them. This includes creating an AI-powered organization, a challenge that many leaders are currently facing.

## Key Takeaways

1. **AI as an Adaptive Challenge**  
   Integrating AI into your organization is an adaptive challenge in itself—there’s no one-size-fits-all approach. However, the effort invested in this transition will pay off. Dr. Aylor believes that in the near future, AI will be able to solve problems with clear solutions, allowing humans to focus on more complex, uniquely human challenges.

2. **The Attitude of Adaptive Leaders**  
   Adaptive leaders are "learn-it-alls" rather than "know-it-alls." They actively seek team feedback before making major decisions and emphasize collaboration. Dr. Aylor states, “We have no chances of solving the adaptive challenges we’re facing nowadays if we rely on the genius brain of one.” The collective intelligence of diverse teams is essential.

3. **smart Experimentation**  
   Innovation thrives on smart experimentation. Dr. Aylor emphasizes that part of experimentation involves failure. Leaders should anticipate a certain level of failure and communicate this understanding to their teams. Cultivating psychological safety is fundamental for fostering healthy, productive teams.

## Conclusion

WorkLab is a platform where experts share their insights about the future of work. Microsoft values a range of perspectives in this dialogue. While the experts’ opinions and findings are their own, they enrich our understanding of emerging trends and strategies in the workplace.

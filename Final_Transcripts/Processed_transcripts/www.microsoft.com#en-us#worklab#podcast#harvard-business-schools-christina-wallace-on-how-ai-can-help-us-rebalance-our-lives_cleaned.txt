## Introduction

This is WorkLab, the podcast from Microsoft. I’m your host, Molly Wood. On WorkLab, we hear from experts about the future of work, from how to use AI effectively to how to empower people for flexible work.

## Insights from Christina Wallace

Christina Wallace, a Harvard Business School instructor, serial entrepreneur, and author of the book *The Portfolio Life*, discusses how leaders and individuals should rethink careers and personal growth in an AI-powered work environment. She shares the joy of seeing her students grasp the potential of AI, illustrating how it can serve not just as a virtual assistant but as a “virtual chief of staff." This transformation allows for more time dedicated to creative thinking and serendipity, as well as opportunities for rest and recharge.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Rebalancing Life and Work**: In her book, Wallace presents a vision where career, personal life, and side interests are in constant balance, similar to a well-managed financial portfolio. She emphasizes, “If you can develop an identity that is so much broader than just how you monetize your time today, you have a ton more optionality and flexibility in how you might need to zig and zag to survive moments of disruption."

2. **Integration of AI Tools**: Wallace believes that AI tools will become integrated into our work processes akin to how spreadsheets and calculators were adopted in the past. She notes, “It doesn’t mean we don’t teach arithmetic anymore; it just means once we teach the backbone of it, you can go faster and build a financial model off of that instead of doing it all by hand.”

3. **AI as a Collaborative Partner**: She has witnessed her students at Harvard Business School unlock the potential of AI as a partner and collaborator. “You can actually use it to get to the so what? questions,” Wallace states. “Don't just find me all of the search results—parse them, find the connections, and after having correlated these things for me, then I can use that information to make a judgment call.”

## Conclusion

WorkLab serves as a platform for experts to share insights about the evolving nature of work. Microsoft values diverse voices, recognizing that the opinions and findings of the interviewees are their own and do not necessarily represent Microsoft’s research or opinions.

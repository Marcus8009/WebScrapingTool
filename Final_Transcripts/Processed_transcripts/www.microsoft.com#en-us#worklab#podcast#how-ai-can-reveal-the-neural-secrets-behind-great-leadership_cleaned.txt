## Introduction

This is WorkLab, the podcast from Microsoft. I’m your host, Molly Wood. On WorkLab, we hear from experts about the future of work, from how to use AI effectively to what it takes to thrive in our new world of work.

## Guest Introduction

Today, I’m talking to Michael Platt, Director of the Wharton Neuroscience Initiative, and Professor of Marketing, Neuroscience, and Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. He researches how our brains work in relation to communication, decision making, group intelligence, and team building. He’s also written a book on the neuroscience of leadership. He believes that AI-driven insights from neuroscience can transform your business, and he’s here to explain how smart companies are already taking advantage of this potential. Michael, thanks so much for coming on the show.

**Michael Platt:** Well, thank you, Molly. It’s such a pleasure to be here.

## The Neuroscience of Leadership

**Molly Wood:** I’d like to start by asking you about the neuroscience of leadership. What would you say is a fundamental insight from your research about the secret to being a great leader?

**Michael Platt:** There are certain capacities that seem to be super important, and one of the most important, I think, in my research that I’ve found is the ability to connect with others and to create context and to create spaces where people can connect with each other. That is such an important part of who we are as a species. It’s a critical driver of productivity, and it is the foundation of wellbeing. When we think about productivity, creativity, innovation, harmony, and team dynamics—they all really start at the top. That’s where we often see failures of leadership. If you don’t create a harmonious culture, if you don’t lead with integrity, if you’re not a good communicator, things start to fall apart.

**Molly Wood:** This has been one of the themes of this season and even last season, this idea of the importance of humanity and empathy. A key leadership insight in your book is that humans are fundamentally social creatures. A huge part of leadership is facilitating these strong social connections. How do the best leaders do that?

**Michael Platt:** People are beginning to be more mindful about it because, in the past, leadership was thought to be somewhat removed from the people that you actually lead. In fact, being present, devoting your attention, is where things start because our brains are quite limited in their capacity, unlike AI. Where we attend signals to other brains what’s important, and if you’re not paying attention to those around you, their brains know it. It’s important for leaders to recognize how crucial connection is for effective team dynamics, for creating a culture where people show empathy, and where they can work harmoniously, especially during difficult times—social support is also critical for change management.

## Practical Applications

**Molly Wood:** How do you do that? 

**Michael Platt:** There are many ideas, but it often feels daunting to know which ones to deploy effectively. Neuroscience can help, providing insights that go beyond self-reports and surveys—people often aren’t completely honest or self-aware. Neuroscience can surface what’s going on beneath the surface, which can shed light on how effective a particular strategy or intervention might be for fostering strong connections.

**Molly Wood:** Can you give us some examples of strategies that work and maybe those that don’t work as well?

**Michael Platt:** One approach we’ve developed is creating space for authentic conversations. We work from a structured set of conversations designed to take people who don’t know each other into closer relationships in a short time frame—like an hour. It begins with casual icebreakers and progresses to deeper discussions. Authenticity, attention, and active listening foster trust. Engaging in these ways activates circuitry in our brains that manage social connections.

### Brain Synchrony

This process is what leads to what we call "brain synchrony." When you and I are engaged in a conversation, our brains can begin to resonate—that is, the same patterns of activity in my brain can be observed in yours, indicating shared emotions and thoughts. This synchrony extends to our bodies, leading to physiological alignment, like our heartbeats. 

**Molly Wood:** That sounds wild!

**Michael Platt:** It feels almost like magic. Moreover, when people are synchronized with each other, it fosters psychological safety, which boosts open communication and enhances team dynamics.

## AI and Leadership

**Molly Wood:** What role does AI have in fostering those essential connections?

**Michael Platt:** AI is similar to our natural intelligence, but it differs fundamentally in many ways. The buzz around large language models showcases how responsive and conversational AI can be. Research indicates that AI can be more persuasive than humans, with some AI therapists and doctors rated as warmer and more empathetic compared to human counterparts. A potential improvement would be for AI to integrate synchrony into their interactions, enhancing trust and connection. 

## Predictions and Decision Making

**Molly Wood:** So, there are elements of what you study that can be translated into verbal interactions?

**Michael Platt:** Exactly. We delve into fundamental neuroscience alongside less obtrusive, scalable measures. Synchrony can even be observed in movement; mirroring someone’s movements can synchronize physiological states. Many cultures engage in rhythmic group activities designed to foster synchrony, which could be harnessed in AI systems to enhance user interaction. 

**Molly Wood:** Fascinating. 

**Michael Platt:** It gets even more interesting when we discuss the predictive capabilities of our brains. Our brains work as prediction engines, constantly forecasting based on past experiences. This feedback loop is what we can harness when considering how AI and our brains operate differently yet comparably.

**Molly Wood:** In terms of our predictions being influenced by our biases, could AI serve to correct these biases?

**Michael Platt:** Absolutely. Our brains are often flawed, interpreting the world through various biases. AI can provide nudges away from these ingrained behaviors, steering us towards more informed decisions. We’ve observed this effect in applications that employ behavioral science principles.

## Neurodata

**Molly Wood:** You've mentioned the significance of neurodata. What exactly is it?

**Michael Platt:** Neurodata encapsulates a range of neurologically relevant information. While companies are unlikely to introduce wearable MRI machines for employees, they are exploring the use of wearable brainwave-sensing devices that can provide insightful data. Such devices can reveal discrepancies between what people say and how they genuinely feel and react.

**Molly Wood:** It sounds as though this data could lead to a more honest and equitable use of AI.

**Michael Platt:** Precisely. In my neural entrepreneurship courses, students explore ways to de-bias various sectors, including policing and matchmaking, ultimately enhancing how we engage with one another and utilize AI.

## Customer Understanding

**Molly Wood:** How can businesses apply these insights to fundamentally enhance their leadership and understand customers better?

**Michael Platt:** The potential for leveraging neuroscience in marketing is significant. Companies can optimize advertising strategies by implementing neuromarketing techniques to better understand how brands resonate emotionally with consumers. By studying brain activity, organizations can pinpoint exactly what drives customer behavior—like nostalgia or social connection—and craft effective messages accordingly.

## Conclusion

**Molly Wood:** Thank you so much for a fascinating conversation.

**Michael Platt:** Well, thank you, Molly.

Nov 12, 2024 | Alysa Taylor - Chief Marketing Officer, Commercial Cloud & AI

In 2024, generative AI emerged as a key driver for business outcomes across every industry. Already, this new generation of AI is having an incredible impact on our world — yet companies are just scratching the surface of what’s possible as they continue to develop new use cases across every role and function.

To help guide organizations on their AI transformation journey, Microsoft recently commissioned a new study through IDC, titled "The Business Opportunity of AI." IDC's findings reveal that when organizations truly commit to and invest in AI, the return on investment (ROI) potential grows significantly.

As companies worldwide delve deeper into AI, Microsoft customers are deploying innovative solutions and discovering how tools like Copilot can transform their day-to-day work.

## Key Trends in AI Adoption

### 1. Enhanced productivity has become table stakes.

Employee productivity is the number one business outcome that companies are trying to achieve with AI. The study shows that 92% of AI users surveyed are utilizing AI for productivity, and 43% report that productivity use cases have provided the greatest ROI. Alongside productivity, other significant generative AI use cases include customer engagement, topline growth, cost management, and product or service innovation. Nearly half of the companies surveyed anticipate a high degree of impact across these areas over the next 24 months.

### 2. Companies are gravitating to more advanced AI solutions.

In the next 24 months, more companies expect to build custom AI solutions tailored directly to industry needs and business processes, including custom copilots and AI agents. This indicates a growing maturity in AI fluency as companies recognize the value of more advanced scenarios.

### 3. Generative AI adoption and value is growing across industries.

Despite being relatively new, generative AI adoption is rapidly expanding—75% of respondents report current usage compared to 55% in 2023. The ROI of generative AI is highest in Financial Services, followed by Media & Telco, Mobility, Retail & Consumer Packaged Goods, Energy, Manufacturing, Healthcare, and Education.

### 5. Looking ahead: Skilling remains a top challenge.

Thirty percent of respondents identified a lack of specialized AI skills in-house, and 26% lack employees capable of learning and working with AI. This corresponds with findings from the Microsoft and LinkedIn 2024 Work Trend Index Annual Report, which shows that 55% of business leaders are concerned about finding skilled talent for these roles.

Over the past year, Microsoft has helped train and certify over 23 million individuals in digital skills. The company is committed to partnering with governments, educational institutions, industry, and civil society to aid millions more in learning to use AI.

## Conclusion

While companies largely implement out-of-the-box generative AI solutions and see significant ROI, more than half of those surveyed expect to build custom industry applications in the next 24 months, showcasing an evolution from basic solutions to competitive advantages.

“We are at an inflection point of autonomous agent development, transitioning from off-the-shelf assistants to custom AI agents that execute complex workflows,” states Ritu Jyoti, GVP/GM, AI and Data Research at IDC. “IDC predicts that business spending to adopt AI will have a cumulative global economic impact of $19.9 trillion through 2030, driving 3.5% of global GDP in that year.”

Key findings from IDC’s study indicate the top barriers organizations face when implementing AI, including data privacy, responsible use, and necessary investments in both technology and skills.

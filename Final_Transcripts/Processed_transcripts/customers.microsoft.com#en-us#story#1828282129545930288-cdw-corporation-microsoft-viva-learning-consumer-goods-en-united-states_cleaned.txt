## Introduction

Technology solutions provider CDW Corporation (CDW) is embracing generative AI to power employee productivity and accelerate customers’ AI journeys. As an early adopter of Microsoft 365 Copilot, CDW aims to facilitate digital transformation by providing robust training resources and establishing collaboration venues on Microsoft Viva Engage.

## Impact of Microsoft 365 Copilot

Microsoft 365 Copilot has significantly helped CDW achieve its goals by improving work quality for 88% of users, enabling 77% to complete tasks faster, and increasing productivity for 85% of users. With over 15,000 employees serving customers across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, CDW is devoted to helping its clients maximize their technology investments.

The company sought firsthand experience with generative AI tools, relying on Microsoft 365 for daily workflows, making Microsoft 365 Copilot a natural fit for its employees. The built-in security of the solution ensured the confidentiality of the company’s information, a crucial factor in their decision to adopt Copilot. “We can stay within a Microsoft 365 environment that our information security team has already vetted,” says Kelly Twomey Eidson, Manager of Enterprise Collaboration at CDW.

## Transformative Experiences

Employees quickly discovered that Copilot represents not just an update but a new way of working. “This is a brand-new way of working, and you have to change your behaviors and workflow to make Copilot an integral part of your daily life,” stated Michael Kennedy, Vice President of Technology Enablement and Strategy at CDW.

Initially, the company acquired licenses for employees to innovate with the new technology, leading to increased excitement and requests for access. By equipping its workforce with Copilot, CDW aimed to enhance customer service through firsthand experience and support clients in their AI journeys.

## Training and Collaboration

The cornerstone of CDW’s successful implementation of Copilot is employee training and internal collaboration. Using online videos and resources within Microsoft Viva Learning, employees complete familiarity training before receiving access to Copilot. The company continually provides additional tips and training opportunities to maximize the solution's value.

CDW utilizes Microsoft Viva Engage for an internal collaboration space called Brainwave, where users can share practical tips and effective prompts. Employees collaborate to refine prompts for tasks, enhancing their ability to use Copilot effectively. “We’re really trying to build this community up and get champions sharing more resources,” adds Eidson.

## Productivity and Feedback

Surveys from CDW’s pilot program indicate significant productivity improvements. 88% of users reported that Copilot improves work quality, while 77% stated they complete tasks more quickly. Features like Microsoft Teams meeting summaries generated by Copilot help employees focus on meaningful discussions, leading to more effective meetings.

According to Steve Staines, Head of Enterprise Collaboration at CDW, the tool has made meetings more productive: “We’re getting feedback from a lot of our coworkers that because Copilot takes the place of writing notes, they are much more present in a meeting.”

Features such as email summaries and content creation are also boosting productivity, allowing employees to spend less mental effort on mundane tasks. Among Copilot users, 80% report a reduction in the mental effort required for daily tasks, while 85% find that Copilot helps them be more productive.

## Customer Engagement and Future Outlook

CDW’s hands-on experience with Copilot not only benefits its internal operations but also allows the company to share successes with customers, facilitating their AI journeys. Sales personnel using Copilot can provide practical tips to clients, enhancing the overall customer experience.

“I cannot wait to see what 10,000 coworkers can accomplish with Copilot,” says Eidson. “I can’t even imagine the information and recommendations we will receive from Copilot in the future.” As CDW continues to build its expertise in AI, it is exploring additional Microsoft Copilot solutions, such as GitHub Copilot and Microsoft Copilot for Security, to streamline operations and tailor solutions for clients.

“We see a huge amount of potential on the horizon to promote Copilot,” says Kennedy. “It’s a step in AI fluency for CDW to understand the off-the-shelf capabilities that can unlock innovation.” The ongoing usage of Copilot within the company promises substantial time savings and has generated excitement about the future potential of this technology.

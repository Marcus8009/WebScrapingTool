## Introduction

From Paris to Sydney, via Bordeaux and Kuala Lumpur, Onepoint has been supporting public and private sector players in their technological transformation for over twenty years. As both a consulting and technology firm, the company refines its expertise to keep pace with major innovations in cybersecurity, cloud computing, data science, and artificial intelligence (AI).

AI is at the forefront of the group, which in 2021 set up its own laboratory for automatic natural language processing (NLP). Convinced of the high potential of this technology, Onepoint is determined to infuse AI, specifically generative AI, at every level of the company. The main goal is to take advantage of this technological revolution to enhance opportunities for its employees and customers. François Binder, Partner Data & AI, Guillaume Debraize, Leader CIO Advisory, and Philippe Harel, Manager of the Data & AI Community, explain how Onepoint enters the era of AI.

## Initial Experiments with Generative AI

Exploring new technologies before initiating any transformations within other organizations is the consulting firm's motto: "We first apply to ourselves what we envision for our customers," confides Guillaume Debraize. With this in mind, Onepoint launched its first experiments in generative AI, combining in-depth analysis and state-of-the-art trends. This exploratory work culminated in a hackathon last October, where 60 consultants tested the capabilities of generative AI and reviewed almost 200 use cases.

Among the approved applications tested during this exercise were Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, and Copilot for Microsoft 365. "Microsoft is the first vendor to market turnkey generative AI solutions," notes the expert. "OpenAI services and Azure stacks are perfectly compatible," adds Philippe Harel.

## The Emergence of Neo

Neo, a secure conversational agent based on Azure OpenAI, is the first use case to emerge from this experimental phase. Designed as a scalable tailor-made product, the application features conversational tools using GPT technology, including a library of prompts and business-oriented solutions that enable the automatic generation of interview reports for HR functions and in-depth analysis of contracts for legal teams. "Thanks to Neo, our 3,300 employees are able to interact with generative AI, saving time and increasing productivity," emphasizes Debraize. The Neo application delivers average productivity gains of between 10% and 15% across all business lines.

## GitHub Copilot Implementation

Onepoint is also testing the GitHub Copilot solution with its developers across all common programming languages, including Javascript, Typescript, C#, Java, Python, Shell, ABAP, json, and yaml. After a pilot phase involving a group of 40 developers, the results are clear: the code is of higher quality and better documented, with productivity gains of around 40% on code production tasks. "The pilot showed us that if developers were properly acculturated to the product, it was really possible to make a quantum leap in productivity," asserts François Binder. The company has trained its teams in waves, prioritizing developers involved in fixed-price projects to optimize margins effectively. A larger rollout to the company's 800 developers is underway, with a second wave involving almost 250 developers already in progress.

## Support for Customers in Generative AI

Convinced by these promising beginnings, Onepoint began to consider how it could support its customers in mastering generative AI, enabling them to "survive this technological disruption." To achieve this, Onepoint decided to "disrupt" its existing offerings by adding a layer of generative AI to projects involving data platforms modernization, move-to-cloud initiatives, and code migrations. "We're part of an approach to systematize AI within our offerings," specifies François Binder, aiming for a more qualitative, competitive, and cost-effective approach.

## Responding to Business Needs

The teams are always on the lookout for new business needs. "Some of our customers want to use generative AI as a tool for automating and optimizing internal processes, while others see it as an opportunity to conquer new markets," explains Philippe Harel. This competitive spirit leads to the creation of personalized new offers adapted to each context, accompanied by training. "Our customers are not all at the same level of maturity regarding AI. That's why it's essential to support their skills development while making them aware of the limits of this technology and the best practices to adopt," says Harel.

## Internal Change Management and Training

The consulting firm actively cultivates an internal culture of AI. “Just as AI has its biases, employees have their own biases when it comes to learning about AI," analyzes Debraize. He emphasizes that the transformation of businesses cannot be achieved without change management, especially since generative AI involves non-technical populations. To facilitate this shift, Onepoint has established a training catalog covering the fundamentals of AI, prompt engineering, ethics, and compliance.

Change management also necessitates the creation of an AI community. This initiative is spearheaded by the “AI Office,” a unit dedicated to structuring and managing all of Onepoint's AI projects. Managed by a Chief AI Officer and staffed with around twenty experts, this unit focuses on technology watch, research, and popularization. The AI Office orchestrates the testing and deployment of both in-house and customer solutions, ensuring the skills needed to capitalize on various projects.

## Future Plans

Now that the foundations have been laid, Onepoint intends to accelerate the pace by industrializing use cases, particularly on the customer side. Over a hundred offers—either under study or in development—are on the team's agenda, indicating a scaling up in the coming months. "We want to boost our consulting business to bring as many projects to life as possible by the end of 2024," shares Debraize.

At the same time, Neo will continue to evolve with more personalized generative AI solutions tailored closely to the Onepoint context. The Copilot solution will also be deployed to employees to ensure full participation in the generative AI initiative. "We're doing everything we can to fully embark our team in the generative AI adventure and give each of our consultants the means to become augmented consultants," concludes Binder.

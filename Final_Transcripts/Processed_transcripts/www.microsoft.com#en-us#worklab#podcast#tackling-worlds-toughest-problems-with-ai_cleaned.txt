Today I’m talking with Juan Lavista Ferres, Microsoft Chief Data Scientist and the director of the AI for Good Lab at Microsoft. Lavista Ferres co-founded the lab in 2018 and leads its team of dedicated data scientists and researchers who use AI to help address challenges around the globe, working especially closely with government agencies and nonprofits. In this episode, we discuss how AI is being applied to everything from increasing biodiversity to preserving cultural artifacts to medical research. Juan also shares some responsible AI practices and the business value of AI adoption. Please note that our conversation does veer into some heavy topics, including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

## Key Insights from Juan Lavista Ferres

### AI as a Tool for Problem Solving

“With artificial intelligence and data at our fingertips, we now have the tools to address the world’s most pressing problems. We no longer have excuses.” That’s the message of Microsoft Corporate Vice President and Chief Data Scientist of our AI for Good Lab, Juan Lavista Ferres. He leads a team that partners with organizations like the UN, the American Red Cross, and the Nature Conservancy to help them understand how to use AI to further their humanitarian missions.

### Impact of AI on Organizations

Lavista Ferres recently co-authored the book *AI for Good: Applications in Sustainability, Humanitarian Action, and Health*. He joined us on the podcast to share key insights from the book and highlight what business leaders can learn from the lab’s efforts to harness technology to make the world a better place.

#### Four Big Takeaways from the Conversation:

1. **Unlocking Data with AI**  
   AI is a huge unlock for data at any organization. Lavista Ferres emphasizes the impact AI can have on data science, noting his experiences with medical researchers on how algorithms can help extract insights from vast amounts of data. “A lot of organizations have a significant amount of unstructured data... and until very recently that was very difficult to work with,” he says. “Now, thanks to large language model AI, that is changing.”

2. **AI as a Leveler**  
   “I think these AI models have a huge potential to help with the digital divide,” Lavista Ferres states. He explains that human-computer interaction will become easier and more natural, altering how many people live and work. However, he stresses the importance of access to technology to ensure everyone can benefit from these tools.

3. **Enhancing Accessibility**  
   AI is a game changer for accessibility. Lavista Ferres shares his personal experience as a non-native English speaker, highlighting AI’s role as an invaluable editing tool. He believes that AI is transforming the lives of individuals with disabilities, citing examples of those using AI to navigate their environments.

4. **AI in Nonprofits**  
   Nonprofits can greatly benefit from AI for the same reasons as other organizations. Lavista Ferres notes that while the AI for Good Lab assists with disaster response and healthcare research, AI can also help nonprofits with everyday tasks that require substantial resources, enhancing productivity across various operations.

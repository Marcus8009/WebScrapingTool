Four Agency is an independent media, marketing, and communications agency with hubs in the UK and UAE offering a full spectrum of marketing services.

Four quickly identified that Microsoft 365 Copilot would be key technology and rolled it out across the 350-strong team.

Team members love how their use of Copilot is aiding in creative brainstorming, content creation, and reporting tasks as well as saving administrative time.

We identified fairly quickly that Copilot is a key technology for us… it fits into our existing workflow.

Four Agency is an independent media, marketing, and communications agency and certified B-Corp. Its 350-strong team delivers incredible and insightful campaigns and services from hubs in the UK and UAE. Offering a full spectrum of marketing services, Four Agency innovates in many areas to deliver the best services for its clients.

The business knows AI will change the sector immeasurably. Nan Williams, Group Chief Executive of Four Agency Worldwide, explains, “It’s going to change every industry, every organisation, but in marketing services—absolutely. It’s going to be a fundamental change.”

This vision, together with the team’s passion for innovation, led Four Agency to become an early adopter of Microsoft 365 Copilot.

“We want to be seen as really at the cutting edge of this,” Luke Alexander, Chief Digital and AI Officer for Four Agency Worldwide, explains. “We identified fairly quickly that Copilot is a key technology for us. The main reason for that is we are already using the Microsoft stack and it fits into our existing workflow. But, also, we did realise it is significantly better than what is available in the market.”

The Four team understands that people and technology work hand-in-hand. That’s why it invested in staff training and change management around the introduction of Copilot. This focused on inspiring people to be creative with the technology, to become competent in it, and to ensure its responsible, safe use.

The team opted for a universal roll-out. Luke Alexander explains why: “When we looked at introducing Copilot at the agency, we realised that it had to be done properly. We felt this meant it had to be something that everybody across the agency got at the same time, so we all feel like we are pulling together in one effort.”

I really do think the next two to five years are going to be very radical and—for people who engage and explore—they will be very, very beneficial.

The Four team is already benefiting from their creative adoption of the technology. They find that the extra support helps them to meet the tight deadlines common in the agency setting.

Copilot is especially useful in admin heavy processes, such as HR, data analysis, and report generation. It helps the team provide client outputs and reports faster. It's also assisting with creative work, such as generating ideas to kick off brainstorming sessions.

Marcia La-Rose, Head of HR at Four, is excited by the opportunity Copilot presents to spend time on more rewarding value-adding work. She says, “We want to spend more time doing outreach and less time doing paperwork.”

“Where we are today is really just the starting point of how we can use this technology,” enthuses Luke Alexander.

Nan Williams agrees, “I really do think the next two to five years are going to be very radical and—for people who engage and explore—they will be very, very beneficial.”

We want to spend more time doing outreach and less time doing paperwork.

Welcome back to AI at Work, a newsletter and video series that decodes the future of business.

If you‚Äôre struggling to understand what AI can do for your business, I‚Äôd argue the place to start is understanding the most powerful tool in your toolbox.

My job involves helping businesses successfully bring AI to work, and I talk to customers every day. In these conversations, many of the folks I speak with focus on foundational models, typically the large language models (LLMs) that help power AI assistants.

But LLMs‚Äîwhich have received most of the attention in the public conversation around AI‚Äîare just one element of a broader AI system. If the system is a car, think of the LLM as the engine. But a car can‚Äôt hit the road without a few other key elements, like wheels, steering, fuel, and more.

Let‚Äôs look under the hood to see how AI systems work‚Äîand in the process, hopefully inspire you to see new ways of applying AI to your own business.

Since AI assistants work alongside us, we think of them as copilots‚Äîin fact, that‚Äôs why we call our own AI assistant Microsoft Copilot. But every AI system, whether it‚Äôs from Microsoft, ChatGPT, Google, or any other provider, has some universal key parts:

Sometimes you can get what you need from a system that has only these core elements. Ask something straightforward, like ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a great starter car for a new driver?‚Äù and you‚Äôll get helpful and specific suggestions. But you can also try more unexpected questions, like ‚ÄúCould an elephant pull my Tundra?‚Äù (of course, not something I‚Äôd ever recommend doing in real life). The copilot can pull together what the LLM knows about various topics and then apply reasoning based on all that data.

In this case, when I asked Copilot that question, the system correctly inferred that I was talking about my Toyota Tundra. It answered, ‚ÄúTheoretically, an elephant could pull your Tundra,‚Äù and spelled out its reasoning: Asian elephants are known to pull weights heavier than a Tundra. It also offered a do-not-try-this-at-home message: ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a practical or humane use of an elephant‚Äôs strength.‚Äù

That‚Äôs an impressive start, but it‚Äôs more akin to a party trick than a business solution. In a work setting, you need a more complete system. The core elements of a copilot are good at reasoning across general knowledge‚Äîbut they‚Äôre not enough when it comes to bringing in the specific knowledge and skills that can set your business apart. Let‚Äôs look at why.

Foundational models have a key limitation‚Äîthey‚Äôre trained on a finite set of information. So, if your question relates to something not included in their training data, they come up short.

But there are ways to work around that limitation. Namely, you can give the orchestrator access to new knowledge or data sources. For example, when the orchestrator can draw from your work data‚Äîemails, files, meetings, etc.‚Äîit‚Äôs infinitely smarter about your business and its needs.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre an automotive marketer. You can ask Copilot a question like: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a marketer leading the launch of a new electric SUV, and I need to draft a creative brief for our agency to develop a national television ad campaign. One idea is to feature wild animals, including elephants.‚Äù

Then you can point the system to your product photos, files that describe its specific specs, and other inputs, so it understands the subject more broadly and deeply. If you include those resources, you get a very different result. That‚Äôs because the critical pattern in using copilots in business right now is grounding the LLM in your own very particular data.

With a prompt like this, the orchestrator can bring together general know-how from the LLM (the elements needed in a typical creative brief) along with knowledge that‚Äôs specific to your company (the details of your new SUV).

Every time your copilot pulls from deeper or more specific wells of knowledge it gives you better, more accurate and actionable responses. But there‚Äôs one additional element that uplevels a copilot even more.

Most foundational models come with inherent capabilities, like the ability to summarize information or write new content. But they aren‚Äôt as good at other important skills, like math, drawing, or design‚Äîall things that humans do every day at work. To broaden your copilot‚Äôs capabilities, you need to give it some added skills.

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a creative leader at the ad agency working on that campaign for the electric SUV. Within the Microsoft ecosystem, you could ask Image Creator from Designer for help storyboarding a concept. You might start your prompt with, ‚ÄúCreate a series of images for a TV ad featuring an electric SUV driving through the savanna at sunset. In the first image, we see the SUV emerge from behind a thicket of tall grass‚Ä¶‚Äù

In other words, your copilot can help you come up with rough storyboards instantly‚Äîand you might create them during a meeting to bring your concept to life while everyone is brainstorming. That way, you get the weak ideas out of the way quickly and can spend more time focusing on the strong ones.

Image creation is just one example of a copilot skill. The ability to code, to automate complex business processes, to make large databases of information instantly accessible with AI‚Äîeach represents new skills you can turn on for your copilot.

There‚Äôs a lot of hype around foundational models, and much of that hype is well deserved. They are the technology that has opened this new chapter in AI innovation. But while they‚Äôre an important part of the system, they‚Äôre just one part. By carefully orchestrating the interactions between the user, knowledge, skills, and foundational models, the copilot becomes even more powerful than the sum of its parts. That‚Äôs the real unlock that will add value to the work you do every day‚Äîso that when you step on the accelerator, you‚Äôll end up exactly where you need to go.

Great Read Jared ‚Ä¶ To truly harness the power of AI, the orchestration of foundational models with an integrated UX, memory, and grounding is not just about functionality .. it‚Äôs all about creating a seamless synergy between knowledge and skills that augments and elevates human potential .

I quite like this diagram. 

In the near/next version of the foundational model, the productivity surge given by the core LLM will level off. Then, it'll be the org-specific add-ins and process integrations that will advance the value proposition.

Absolutely, your point about focusing on the entire AI system rather than just the models really resonates! It‚Äôs like a reminder that having a powerful engine isn‚Äôt enough‚Äîyou need the whole car to be in sync to make the journey smooth. The idea of grounding AI in specific business data and expanding its capabilities with skills is a game-changer. It‚Äôs all about creating more tailored and effective solutions, not just for businesses but for any sector that could benefit from this approach. I‚Äôm thinking about how this could transform areas like education, where AI could adapt to the needs of individual learners, or healthcare, where integrating specific medical data could lead to more accurate diagnoses. 
Exciting times ahead with these advancements!

Love this analogy.. Jared Spataro ,I can add another one. When I want to cook a Michelin star meal, I need the right ingredients (foundation data ingestion ) and in the right amount (no data/ instruction overload -relate it to prompting) with the right recipe (orchestration) and the final presentation (designing the outcome we want).(uX).
If the ingredients (foundation data) go wrong (the star Chef fails to achieve the desired outcome)
A Michelin star Chef, keeps training the recipe (updating instructions /prompts )till the Chef gets the desired results. 
Yes, the new aspiring chef definitely needs an expert coach‚Äôs handholding and structure to get there though..

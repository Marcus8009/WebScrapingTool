Localiza needed to increase employee productivity and optimize repetitive manual tasks.

The company implemented Microsoft 365 Copilot and integrated AI to automate processes and improve efficiency.

Localiza reduced 8.3 working hours per employee per month, improved inclusivity, and increased productivity in key areas of the company.

When Microsoft introduced Copilot embedded within Microsoft 365, we saw a great opportunity to be at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation. Since our entire base is built on Microsoft 365, it made sense for us to get on board to enhance employee productivity.

Localiza&Co is a leader in the mobility industry in Latin America, with over 700 branches across seven countries: Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The company has been operating for more than 50 years and employs approximately 21,000 people.

The company has distinguished itself through its ability to innovate and adapt to market changes, consistently prioritizing customer service excellence and becoming a benchmark for industry evolution. Recently, Localiza&Co embarked on a digital transformation journey centered on generative AI by implementing Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI tool that is revolutionizing the way the company operates and delivers value.

The decision to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot was driven by the need to innovate and improve employee productivity and efficiency. The company had already been exploring traditional AI in several ways, but with the onset of generative AI and the launch of Copilot, there was a new frontier to be conquered. According to Denys Damm, End-User Experience Lead in Information Technology at Localiza&Co, “When Microsoft introduced Copilot embedded within Microsoft 365, we saw a great opportunity to be at the forefront of artificial intelligence innovation. Since our entire base is built on Microsoft 365, it made sense for us to get on board to enhance employee productivity.”

8.3 less working hours per employee per month

Localiza&Co was among the first five companies in Brazil to adopt Microsoft 365 Copilot. The initial implementation commenced in 2023 with the issuance of 300 licenses. Since then, the company has been diligently working to ensure that all employees are engaged and using the tool effectively.

Initially, Localiza&Co struggled with creating effective prompts for Copilot. Denys noted that poor prompts lead to unsatisfactory results. "If your prompt is not properly done, it ends up generating a negative result or one that doesn't meet your expectations." To address this, they invested in training and hackathons, helping employees enhance their skills for better productivity.

Localiza&Co has developed a methodology to demonstrate the effectiveness and positive impact of Microsoft 365 Copilot on the company's business. The company has observed a significant improvement in employee and team productivity when using Copilot to create dashboards for Microsoft Viva Insights. As the project matured, they began to identify the potential gains the tool could offer and outlined action plans to achieve them. The adoption of Copilot not only increased productivity but also improved work-life balance, helping employees work smarter.

Among Copilot users, 50% are top users, 17% are heavy users, 24% use it moderately, and only 8% are occasional users. Heavy usersreported a productivity increase of 10.6%, while the average increase among all users was 4.5%. In addition, 81% of top users and 68% of heavy users reported improvements in productivity and work quality. Most users stated that they would miss working with Copilot on a day-to-day basis if licenses were removed.

During the second wave of adoption, experts and leaders increasingly used the tool, especially Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 Chat. The company implemented a policy to rotate occasional users monthly due to high demand. Copilot hackathons were held to boost usage. A new approach for champions was also introduced, focusing on adaptable use cases instead of specific areas.

With the implementation of Copilot, the company achieved an average reduction of 8.3 working hours per employee per month. Among the most engaged employees, this reduction was even more significant, reaching 19 working hours per month. As Copilot becomes more integrated at Localiza&Co, the company anticipates that these users will reduce up to 25 working hours per month. Denys states, "Once we can make these productivity gains tangible, we can scale them across the company, providing a technological competitive advantage to our business."

Copilot was able to optimize repetitive and manual tasks, allowing the team to focus on more strategic activities, thereby improving their day-to-day work.

Additionally, one of the most notable examples was the significant reduction in the time required to complete certain repetitive and manual tasks. Before the implementation, a team of two to three people would spend almost an entire day consolidating and analyzing customer feedback on evaluation platforms. With Copilot, this process was drastically reduced, allowing the team to complete the same activities in just a few hours. Weslley Moraes, a specialist at Localiza&Co added, "Copilot was able to optimize repetitive and manual tasks, allowing the team to focus on more strategic activities, thereby improving their day-to-day work."

Localiza&Co's marketing team greatly benefited from Copilot, which simplified creating images, marketing campaigns, and internal communications like company-wide emails. This saved time and ensured messages were clear and aligned with company goals.

Copilot has become an invaluable asset for Localiza&Co in crisis management. During emergencies, the tool efficiently summarized information discussed in Microsoft Teams meetings and generated standardized reports to keep all stakeholders continuously informed. This process facilitated quicker decision-making, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of incident response.

Copilot played a crucial role in including hearing-impaired employees in live meetings through real-time transcription and automatic summaries. Juliana Rocha, a Digital Transformation Specialist at Localiza stated, "Copilot has allowed employees with hearing impairments to participate more actively in meetings, thanks to the transcription and creation of automatic summaries in real time."

Localiza aims to expand its use of generative AI across more areas and tools. Juliana Rocha mentioned, "We have a pilot for AI Builder and Copilot Studio, involving nearly 30 people, and we've identified 42 promising use cases."

The company is also exploring Microsoft Copilot for Finance and plans to implement Copilot in other areas to boost productivity and efficiency.

Localiza's digital transformation with Microsoft 365 Copilot shows how technology can drive operational excellence by providing measurable impacts on both human and quantitative levels. With strong results and a forward-looking plan, Localiza is set to continue innovating in the mobility sector.
